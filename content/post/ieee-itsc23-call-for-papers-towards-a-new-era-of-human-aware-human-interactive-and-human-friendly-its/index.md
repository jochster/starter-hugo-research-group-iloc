The 26th edition of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2023) is the annual flagship conference sponsored by the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS). This event hosts an attractive agenda of technical  contributions, keynote presentations, tutorials, special sessions, and workshops on topics related to the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The conference aims to gather researchers and practitioners working in this field towards sharing, discussing, and opening new paths in the theory, analysis, simulation, data-based modeling, experimentation, deployment, and case studies embracing transportation and mobility at their core. In particular, ITSC 2023 builds upon its motto to invite and encourage prospective authors to present results, findings, perspectives, and developments related to the implementation and deployment of ITS applications that consider human interaction at the core of their design.

High-quality works presented in ITSC 2023 will be invited for their extension and submission to a special issue in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, in selected topics related to the scope of the conference. Details will be provided soon.
