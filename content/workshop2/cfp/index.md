# Scope Of the Workshop

This workshop aims to address the localization integrity requirements of automated vehicles. The concept of integrity is defined as “a measure of trust which can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the total system”. In particular, it is a critical performance indicator for the navigation of highly automated vehicles (e.g., SAE L3 and above). To guarantee the safe driving of an AV in varying environments, measures of the localization information gathered from different sensors, such as LiDAR, IMU and GNSS, are required. Continuously and reliably estimating a vehicle’s position in varying driving environments is essential for autonomous driving and safe operation. However, dynamic and complex traffic environments make high-integrity localization very challenging in the vehicular domain. In our 2nd iLoc workshop, we want to emphasize the importance of integrity in ITS and address the scientific challenges in managing localization integrity for vehicle navigation in complex traffic environments, including its use as part of perception tasks.

# Topics of Interest

At this workshop, the research topics of interests include but are not limited to:

* What are the leading factors for high-integrity localization for AVs?
* Which multi-sensor architectures and data fusion methods are best suited for autonomous driving?
* How to estimate the uncertainty and integrity risks applicable to model-based and data-driven approaches to localization?
* How can maps be used to increase localization integrity?
* How to combine a vehicle kinematic model and road geometry to improve integrity estimation?
* What are the integrity metrics needs for AVs?
* Are there any emergent standards applicable to the estimation of integrity in ITS?
* How to verify experimentally the system localization integrity when considering low risks?
* Uncertainty estimation of LiDAR point clouds registration and imagery data processing in e.g., probabilistic and deep learning-based models
* State-of-the-art deep learning multi-modal data fusion for e.g., GNSS, LiDAR point clouds, images, 3D map localization information with integrity estimation.

# Workshop Sessions

The workshop is organized over a full day divided into four sessions (two in the morning and two in the afternoon). Each session contains at least one invited speaker and one workshop paper. A poster session is also planned between the morning and afternoon sessions to facilitate discussions among participants.

## Invited Talks

The list of our invited speakers is being constantly updated. Check out the up-to-date list: [\>>](/speaker)
***
## Paper Presentations

All workshop papers will be peer-reviewed and included in the ITSC conference proceedings.

All accepted workshop papers will be offered a time slot for an oral presentation. 
***
## Poster Session

In addition to oral presentations, the 2nd iLoc workshop invites contributions to our poster session. All poster presentors will be provided **physical poster boards**, however, should take responsibility for their own printing work. Workshop paper authors are also encouraged to participate in the poster session.

More information on the poster session will be made available soon.

# Poster Submission Guidlines
If you wish to submit a contribution to our poster session, please note:
* You will be provided a **physical poster board** during the workshop. However, you should do printing work on your own,
* Your contribution will not be peer-reviewed, if you fail in submitting your manuscript via ITSC-2023 papercept platform before the submission deadline,
* You will be invited to the poster session, if you submit your workshop paper successfully, and your manuscript is accepted to be included in the ITSC conference proceedings,
* Please contact Philippe Xu (philippe.xu@hds.utc.fr) for a poster-only contribution (without a workshop paper submission)

Poster submission deadline: 
* Tentative: <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">August 31, 2023</span>
