## Scope of the Workshop

This workshop aims to address the localization integrity requirements of automated vehicles. The concept of integrity is defined as “a measure of trust which can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the total system”. In particular, it is a critical performance indicator for the navigation of highly automated vehicles (e.g., SAE L3 and above). To guarantee the safe driving of an AV in varying environments, measures of the localization information gathered from different sensors, such as LiDAR, IMU and GNSS, are required. Continuously and reliably estimating a vehicle’s position in varying driving environments is essential for autonomous driving and safe operation. However, dynamic and complex traffic environments make high-integrity localization very challenging in the vehicular domain. In our 2nd iLoc workshop, we want to emphasize the importance of integrity in ITS and address the scientific challenges in managing localization integrity for vehicle navigation in complex traffic environments, including its use as part of perception tasks.

## Topics of Interest

At this workshop, the research topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* What are the leading factors for high-integrity localization for AVs?
* Which multi-sensor architectures and data fusion methods are best suited for autonomous driving?
* How to estimate the uncertainty and integrity risks applicable to model-based and data-driven approaches to localization?
* How can maps be used to increase localization integrity?
* How to combine a vehicle kinematic model and road geometry to improve integrity estimation?
* What are the integrity metrics needs for AVs?
* Are there any emergent standards applicable to the estimation of integrity in ITS?
* How to verify experimentally the system localization integrity when considering low risks?
* Uncertainty estimation of LiDAR point clouds registration and imagery data processing in e.g., probabilistic and deep learning-based models
* State-of-the-art deep learning multi-modal data fusion for e.g., GNSS, LiDAR point clouds, images, 3D map localization information with integrity estimation.

## Poster Sessions in the Workshop

In addition to oral presentations, a poster session is planned in the afternoon session to facilitate discussions among participants.

## Poster Presentation Guidelines
We are pleased to open a call for poster presentations in this workshop.

The call is open to present novel, past or ongoing research related to the topics covered by the workshop.

Authors that will present a related paper at the ITSC'23 conference are also more than welcome to present a poster in this workshop.

Practical information:
* Information to provide: a proposal should contain **the name and affiliation of the authors, a title, and an abstract**
* Submission: the proposal needs to be sent to Dr. Philippe Xu (philippe.xu@hds.utc.fr)
* Submission deadline: <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">August 15, 2023</span>
* Notification of acceptance: <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">August 16, 2023</span>

Please note:
* Posters are printed and brought by authors to the conference venue. Information about local companies capable of printing posters can be provided by the ITSC'23 conference organizers on demand (itsc2023@tisasa.es),
* The poster presentation will not be peer-reviewed nor included in the ITSC conference proceedings,
* Poster size recommendations by ITSC'23 conference: _Panels allow for poster sizes of max. 95 cm (width) x 191 cm (height), with a vertical orientation. Standard A0 (841 x 1189 mm) is highly recommended._ ([> ITSC'23 paper presentation guidelines](https://2023.ieee-itsc.org/paper-presentation/))
* Please contact Philippe Xu (philippe.xu@hds.utc.fr) in case of any questions.
