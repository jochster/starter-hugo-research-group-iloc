The iLoc workshop is to emphasize **the importance of integrity in ITS** addressing the scientific challenges with respect to _the management of localization integrity for vehicle navigation in complex traffic environments including its use as part of perception tasks_.

### Research Questions of Interest:
- What are the <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">leading factors</span> for high-integrity localization for AVs, e.g., road geometry, vehicle dimension, sensor accuracy, environmental factors, vehicle motion, and other road users?
- Which multi-sensor architectures and data fusion methods are best suited for autonomous driving? 
- How to estimate the <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">uncertainty</span> and <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">integrity risks</span> applicable to model-based and data-driven approaches to localization?
- How can <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">maps</span> be used to increase localization integrity?
- How to combine a vehicle kinematic model and road geometry to improve integrity estimation? Is the sequence of AV’s maneuver tasks of driving from position A to B well defined?
- What are the <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">integrity metrics</span> needs for AVs? That is, in longitudinal, lateral, vertical (e.g., multi-level road interchanges), orientation (pitch, roll, and yaw angles).
- Are there any <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">emergent standards</span> applicable to the estimation of integrity in the Intelligent Transportation field?
- How to verify experimentally the system localization integrity when considering low risks? E.g., down to 10e-5 or below, and under numerous driving conditions?
  
### Topics of Interest:
- Uncertainty propagation and updates while an AV drives in different environments.
- Novel algorithm and requirement definition for integrity, continuity, availability, and accuracy evaluation for intelligent transportation
- Map reference with its own integrity measure, including 2D digital map, high-definition map, 3D map/3D city model, even more precise survey map with both dynamic and static objects.
- Quantification and representation of the models’ aleatoric (or statistical) and epistemic (or systematic) uncertainties for both environmental perception and localization.
- Uncertainty estimation of LiDAR point clouds registration and imagery data processing in e.g., probabilistic and deep learning-based models.
- State-of-the-art deep learning multi-modal data fusion for e.g., GNSS, LiDAR point clouds, images, 3D map localization information with integrity estimation.
