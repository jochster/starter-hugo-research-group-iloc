  the iLoc workshop is to emphasize the importance of integrity in ITS addressing the scientific challenges with respect to the management of localization integrity for vehicle navigation in complex traffic environments including its use as part of perception tasks.
  The following lists the potential but not exhausted research topics:
	- Uncertainty propagation and updates while an AV drives in different environments.
	- Novel algorithm and requirement definition for integrity, continuity, availability, and accuracy evaluation for intelligent transportation
	- Map reference with its own integrity measure, including 2D digital map, high-definition map, 3D map/3D city model, even more precise survey map with both dynamic and static objects.
	- Quantification and representation of the modelsâ€™ aleatoric (or statistical) and epistemic (or systematic) uncertainties [9] for both environmental perception and localization.
	- Uncertainty estimation of LiDAR point clouds registration and imagery data processing in e.g., probabilistic and deep learning-based models.
	- State-of-the-art deep learning multi-modal data fusion for e.g., GNSS, LiDAR point clouds, images, 3D map localization information with integrity estimation.
