- Bizkaibus (coming from the AIRPORT): Line A3247 can be used for getting from the airport to Bilbao City Centre. Buses depart every 20 minutes from the airport (3€ ride) and they stop in city centre (Moyua Square) but they also have stops in Gran Vía 79 (4 minutes from Euskalduna) and Bilbao Intermodal (8 minutes from Euskalduna) Status of the bus can be checked in real time.

#### By car: 
The congress centre has its own parking.

#### By train:
- Renfe: Abando station has a link to the underground (you should take any underground train from the platform for trains bound for Plentzia) and the Abando tram stop is right near there (take a tram bound for Basurto). Should you wish to walk from this station to the Bizkaia Aretoa building, the journey would take just over 20 minutes.

- FEVE: La Concordia Station (also known as ‘Estación de Santander’) is next door to Abando Station, and therefore the same routes mentioned above can be used to reach the Bizkaia Aretoa building from here.
